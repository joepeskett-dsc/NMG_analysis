# NMG_analysis

This repo contains a variety of exploration of the NMG dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/research-datasets). While it would be a bonus to get develop a useful predictive model from this data, this repo will be mostly concerned with simple exploratory data analysis, visualisation and communication of key themes that can be drawn out of this survey. 

My hope is that this will lead to a couple of blog posts showing some of the techniques used - in particular I'd like to include something basic using the [new D3 support in R Studio 1.2](https://blog.rstudio.com/tags/d3).
